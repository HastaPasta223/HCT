		<p> History of computational technology or HCT for short is a educational webiste that has the goal of teaching people about the history and sginificance of various comptutational technologies.<br>
		In order to ultimately demonstrate how humanity was able to reach what we now collectivly know today as a PC or personal computer.<br>
		We will go about achieving this goal through various pages.<br> First, within the timeline there will be a comprehensive set of events show that created the first computational techologies and then the personal computer as well as featuring more new/advanced computational technologies that more powerful than a PC.<br>
		In turn, not only will we teach the history of computaional techologies, but at the same time show what future innovations such as artifical intelligence and quantum computing.</p>
