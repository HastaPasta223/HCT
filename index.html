		<p> History of computational technology or HCT for short is an educational webiste that has the goal of teaching people about the history and significance of various comptutational technologies.<br>
		In order to ultimately demonstrate how humanity was able to reach what we now collectivly know today as a PC or personal computer.<br>
		We will go about achieving this goal through various pages.<br> First, within the timeline there will be a comprehensive set of events to show how the first computational techologies were created up until the personal computer. Next, go into more detail as the who were the people that contributed to the creation of said computational technologies.
		Finally, feature more new/advanced computational technologies such as quantum computing and ai.<br>
		In turn, not only will we teach the history of computational techologies up unitl the PC, but at the same time show what future innovations lie ahead.</p>
