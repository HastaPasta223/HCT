		<p> History of computational technology or HCT for short is a educational webiste that has the goal of teaching people about the history and sginificance of various comptutational technologies.
		In order to ultimately demonstrate how humanity was able to reach what we now collectivly know today as a PC or personal computer.
		We will go about achieving this goal through various pages. First, within the timeline there will be a comprehensive set of events show that created the first computational techologies and then the personal computer as well as featuring more new/advanced computational technologies that more powerful than a PC.
		In turn, not only will we teach the history of computaional techologies, but at the same time show what future innovations such as artifical intelligence and quantum computing.</p>
