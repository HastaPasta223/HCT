		<h3>Abacus</h3>
		<p>Around 3,000 BCE a device called the abacus was used to perform mathematical calculations.</p>
		<h3>Antikythera Mechanism</h3>
		<p>In 1902, a Greek archaeologist discovered the Antikythera Mechanism, which dates back to 205-60 BCE and is the world's first analogous computer. The device was used for astrology as it was used to calculate the position of the sun, moon, and planets.</p>

			<blockquote><q>…there is nothing … so troublesome to mathematical practice ...than the multiplications, divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers, which besides the tedious expense of time are for the most part subject to many slippery errors, I began therefore to consider … by what certain and ready art I might remove those hindrances.</q></blockquote>
		<p>In 1614, John Napier published his work on simplifying arithmetic by introducing the idea of logarithms which considerably shortened the time it took for calculations.</p>

		<p>William Oughtred was an English mathematician who intvented the earliest version of the slide rule. A slide rule is a device with movable scales by which simple calculations such as multiplying, dividing, logarithms can be carried out. William's version of the tool consisted of two scales that were either linear or circular logarithmic</p>
