      <h4>John Napier</h4>
      <p>In 1614, John Napier published his work on simplifying arithmetic by introducing the idea of logarithms which considerably shortened the time it took for calculations.</p>
      <blockquote><q>…there is nothing … so troublesome to mathematical practice ...than the multiplications, divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers, which besides the tedious expense of time are for the most part subject to many slippery errors, I began therefore to consider … by what certain and ready art I might remove those hindrances.</q></blockquote>

      <p>Charles Babbage conceptualizes the Analytical Engine, considered the first general-purpose mechanical computer.Babbage's proposed Difference Engine was a special-purpose digital computing machine for the automatic production of mathematical tables (such as logarithm tables, tide tables, and astronomical tables). The Difference Engine consisted entirely of mechanical components — brass gear wheels, rods, ratchets, pinions, etc. </p>
      <blockquote><q>If unwarned by my example, any man shall undertake and shall succeed in really constructing an engine ... upon different principles or by simpler mechanical means, I have no fear of leaving my reputation in his charge, for he alone will be fully able to appreciate the nature of my efforts and the value of their results.</q></blockquote>

      <p>ARPANET was the first operational packet-switching network and the predecessor of the modern internet. It was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S Department of Defense in 1969. The ARPANET connected four universities, including UCLA, UCSB, SRI, and the University of Utah, and allowed them to share information and resources over a decentralized network. The ARPANET used packet-switching technology to transfer data, which allowed for efficient and reliable communication between different nodes on the network.</p>

      <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while he was working at CERN in Switzerland. The WWW is an interconnected system of hypertext documents that are accessed over the internet using a web browser. The web is based on the HTTP protocol, which allows for the transfer of data between web servers and clients. The WWW was designed to be a decentralized system that would allow people to share and access information globally.</p>

      <p>The Deep Learning Resurgence began in 2010 and was a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. The resurgence was led by a group of researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, who developed new algorithms and techniques that significantly improved the performance of deep learning models. The deep learning resurgence paved the way for breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and other applications of AI. Deep learning has since become a dominant approach in the field of AI and has contributed to significant advancements in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.

      <p>In 2019, Google announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy, a significant milestone in the development of quantum computing technology. Quantum supremacy is the point at which a quantum computer can perform a calculation that is beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful classical computers. Google's quantum computer, called Sycamore, was able to perform a specific calculation in just 200 seconds, which would have taken a classical computer thousands of years. The achievement of quantum supremacy has significant implications for a wide range of fields, including cryptography, chemistry, and artificial intelligence. <p>
