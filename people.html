    <div class="text">
    <p>As one of four children born, Charles Babbage lived his early years in Walworth, Surrey. Babbage continued to further his education in mathematics at Trinity, Cambridge in 1810. From 1813 to 1868, Babbage "published six full-length works and nearly 
        ninety papers," while simultaneously pioneering lighthouse signalling, inventing the ophthalmoscope, proposing black box recorders for railways, and more. Babbage played a vital role in the development of modern technologies, and can be found in the timeline.</p>

    <div class="text"> 
    <p>Born in London's East End, British engineer Tommy Flower would later on develop an impressive machine that would essentially be a pivoting move in WWII: The Colossus. Flowers earned his electrical engineering degree from the University of London. He then joined a research center in Northwest London in 1930. Here is where his Flowers would explore the use of electronics in telephone exchanges. More information about the Flower's impact on modern technology with the Colossus can be found on the timeline.</p>
