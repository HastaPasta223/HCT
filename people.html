          <p>John Napier, born on February 1, 1550, in Edinburgh, Scotland, was a renowned mathematician, physicist, and astronomer. He is most famous for his discovery of logarithms and the invention of "Napier's bones", a device used for manual calculations. Napier also introduced the use of the decimal point in arithmetic and mathematics. As the 8th Laird of Merchiston, his Latinized name was Ioannes Neper. His birthplace, Merchiston Tower, is now part of Edinburgh Napier University, and there is a memorial dedicated to him at St Cuthbert's in Edinburgh. His contributions have significantly influenced the field of mathematics. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>

          <p>William Oughtred, born on March 5, 1574, in Eton, Buckinghamshire, England, was an English mathematician and Anglican clergyman. He is credited with inventing the slide rule around 1622, a device that significantly increased calculation speeds and contributed to advancements in the physical sciences and engineering. Oughtred was the first to use two logarithmic scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division. He also introduced the "x" symbol for multiplication and the abbreviations "sin" and "cos" for the sine and cosine functions. His contributions to mathematical notation and tools have had a lasting impact on the field. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>

              <div class="text">
              <p>Wilhelm Schickard, born on April 22, 1592, was a German professor of Hebrew and astronomy. He is known for his invention of one of the first calculating machines in 1623. This machine, often referred to as a “calculating clock”, could perform operations of addition and subtraction automatically, and multiplication and division partially. Schickard's machine was particularly notable for its integration of a system of rotated Napier's rods for multiplication with a design for an adding machine. Despite the debate about what constitutes a "mechanical calculator", Schickard's work has been influential, and he has been called "the father of the computer age". In addition to his contributions to mathematics and computing, Schickard was also a skilled cartographer, engraver, and astronomer. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>

              <p>Blaise Pascal, born on June 19, 1623, in Clermont-Ferrand, France, was a French mathematician, physicist, religious philosopher, and master of prose. He is known for laying the foundation for the modern theory of probabilities, formulating what came to be known as Pascal's principle of pressure, and propagating a religious doctrine1. Between 1642 and 1644, Pascal built a machine to help his father do tax calculations. This machine, called the Pascaline, was the first digital calculator. Pascal also conducted experiments on atmospheric pressure, and his contributions to this area of study were so great that the metric unit of pressure is named a Pascal. The computer programming language “Pascal” is also named after him. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>

                  <div class="text">
                  <p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, born on July 1, 1646, was a German philosopher, mathematician, and political adviser. He is known for his invention of the differential and integral calculus, independent of Sir Isaac Newton. Leibniz played a major role in European politics and diplomacy of his day and is remembered for his optimism. He also developed the present-day notation for calculus and invented an early calculating machine. During his lifetime, Leibniz perfected the calculating machine invented by Blaise Pascal, laid the ground for integral and differential calculus, founded dynamics, worked on mechanical devices such as clocks, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, and windmills, perfected the binary system of numeration used today in computer operations, devised the theory that all reasoning can be reduced to an ordered combination of elements such as numbers, words, sounds, or colors (the theoretical basis of modern computers), laid the foundation for general topology, a branch of mathematics, strove to formulate a basis for the unification of the churches, and pursued the goal of writing a universal history.

          <p>George Edward Scheutz, born in 1822, was a Swedish inventor who, along with his father Georg Scheutz (1785-1873), built one of the first difference engines. Inspired by Charles Babbage's work, they started their project in 1834 and completed a working prototype in 1843. The device, largely built by Edvard, was made in a wooden frame and operated with three orders of difference. It produced the first tables calculated and printed by machinery. Two expanded versions fully engineered in metal were produced, one in Stockholm in 1853, and the other in London in 1859. Despite their significant contributions to computing, both Georg and Edvard Scheutz died bankrupt.</p>

          ninety papers," while simultaneously pioneering lighthouse signalling, inventing the ophthalmoscope, proposing black box recorders for railways, and more. Babbage played a vital role in the development of modern technologies, and can be found in the timeline.</p>

          <p>Ada Lovelace, born on December 10, 1815, was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is often cited as the world's first computer programmer. From a young age, Lovelace was tutored in mathematics and science, an unusual course of study for a woman in 19th-century England. She conceptualized a flying machine at the age of 12. Lovelace worked closely with Babbage and translated an article about his theoretical analytical engine, augmenting the translation with her own notes that were three times as long as the original paper. These notes contained what some consider to be the first algorithm to be carried out by a machine, thus the first computer program. Her contributions to the field of computing have been significant and lasting. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>

              <p>Herman Hollerith, born on February 29, 1860, in Buffalo, New York, was a German-American statistician, inventor, and businessman. He developed an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards to assist in summarizing information and accounting. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine, patented in 1884, marks the beginning of the era of mechanized binary code and semi-automatic data processing systems. Hollerith's concept dominated the landscape of data processing for nearly a century. He founded a company that was amalgamated in 1911 with several other companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, which was renamed "International Business Machines" (IBM) in 1924. Hollerith is regarded as one of the seminal figures in the development of data processing. More information can be found in the timeline.</p>
